# sd-webui-neutral-prompt

Neutral prompt is an a1111 webui extension that replaces the webui's CFG denoising algorithm with a higher-quality implementation based on more recent research.

## Features

- [Prep-Neg](https://perp-neg.github.io/) cfg algorithm
- standard deviation based CFG rescaling (https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08891)

## Special mentions

Special thanks to these people for helping make this extension possible:

- [Ai-Casanova](https://github.com/AI-Casanova) : shared mathematical knowledge, time and proof-testing of implementation to make the extension more robust
